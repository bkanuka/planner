Use
=======
Open `page1.svg` with Inkscape.  Save file as pdf. 
 * Check the box "PDF+LaTeX: Omit text in PDF and create LaTeX file". 
 * Check the box "Export area is page". 
 * Unchecked "Export area is drawing".
 * Press OK
 * Do the same for `page2.svg`

Now run `python planner.py`

Errors will most likely be caused by an incomplete LaTeX installation. Install missing packages and try again.

(you can always try to get in contact if you're stuck!)
